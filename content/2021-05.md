## Other

I started using [Deno](https://deno.land/).
Deno is secure runtime for TypeScript and JavaScript.
I've been writing a lot of TypeScript lately, so I've been interested in it.

I wanted to write a simple web application in Deno, so I took a quick look at [the documentation](https://deno.land/manual),
and read book([Deno Web Development](https://www.packtpub.com/product/deno-web-development/9781800205666)) about web development in Deno, and wrote a few applications.

[hhatto/ogp-image-vercel](https://github.com/hhatto/ogp-image-vercel) is server application for creating the OGP images.
The pull request in ImageScript was created when I was writing this application.
