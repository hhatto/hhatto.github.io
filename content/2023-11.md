### [fpath](https://github.com/hhatto/fpath)

WIP: modernize Python Package [#5](https://github.com/hhatto/fpath/pull/5)


### tox-pyenv-redux, pyenv-inspect, virtualenv-pyenv

* [un-def/virtualenv-pyenv](https://github.com/un-def/virtualenv-pyenv)
* [un-def/tox-pyenv-redux](https://github.com/un-def/tox-pyenv-redux)
* [un-def/pyenv-inspect](https://github.com/un-def/pyenv-inspect)

These packages are useful for using Python installed with pyenv in tox.
However, they currently only support CPython.
I wanted to support PyPy as well, so I am in the process of testing it.
I think I will be able to pull-request it soon.
