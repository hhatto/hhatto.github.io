[v0.5.2](https://github.com/hhatto/gocloc/releases/tag/v0.5.2) has been released.

#### v0.5.2

- Add Language

### [autopep8](https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8)

#### v2.1.0(WIP)

* Support Python3.12, and drop 3.7 ([#709](https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8/pull/709))
* CI run with PyPy3.10 ([#711](https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8/pull/711))
    * [The PyPy version v7.3.12, which is compliant with Python 3.10, was released in June 2023](https://www.pypy.org/posts/2023/06/pypy-v7312-release.html).
      I have made accommodations for this.


A little while ago, I [migrated from setup.py to pyproject.toml](https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8/pull/705).
I did this using setuptools. For simple projects, it might be good to use [Flit](https://github.com/pypa/flit) as well.
I plan to do the same for several other active projects.

- [PEP-621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/)
- [Configuring setuptools using pyproject.toml files](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/pyproject_config.html)
